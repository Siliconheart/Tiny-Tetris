# Tiny-Tetris Blue Pill STM32

This is an attempt to port AJRussell's Tetris Clone with OLED SSD1306(I2C) for Arduino Nano / Uno to Blue Pill (STM32F103C8T6)

The code is not finished, there is still lots to be done.

Things that need to be added:

1. Make it run on STM32

High score functionality.

Decent random number generator.

Create a letter font, create a proper system for rendering numbers and letters.

Tidy up code and optimize for memory, sort out the globals and types.

Create defines for all the magic numbers but they are useful for now.
